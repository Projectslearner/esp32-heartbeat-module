# ESP32 Heartbeat Module Project

## Project Overview
This project showcases how to utilize a heartbeat sensor with an ESP32 microcontroller to detect the presence of a heartbeat. Heartbeat sensors are crucial for medical and health-related applications, providing real-time detection of heartbeats without physical contact.

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Heartbeat Sensor Module (Digital Output)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Heartbeat Sensor to ESP32:**
   - Connect the digital output of the heartbeat sensor module to GPIO pin 34 on the ESP32.
   - Ensure proper power and ground connections for the heartbeat sensor module.

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication at 9600 baud rate in the `setup()` function using `Serial.begin()`.
   - Configure GPIO pin 34 as an input using `pinMode()` to read the digital output from the heartbeat sensor.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Read the digital sensor value using `digitalRead()`.
     - If a heartbeat is detected (HIGH state), print "Heartbeat detected!" to the Serial Monitor.
     - If no heartbeat is detected (LOW state), print "No heartbeat detected." to the Serial Monitor.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Sensor Sensitivity:** Adjust sensor placement and sensitivity to ensure reliable detection of heartbeats.
   - **Environmental Factors:** Minimize environmental noise and interference for accurate heartbeat readings.

## Applications
- **Health Monitoring:** Monitor and track heartbeat for medical purposes or fitness monitoring.
- **Alarm Systems:** Integrate with alarm systems for detecting cardiac arrest or irregular heartbeats.
- **Biofeedback Devices:** Use in biofeedback devices for real-time physiological data analysis.

## Notes
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Heartbeat sensors provide immediate feedback on the presence of heartbeats, aiding in timely interventions.
- **Serial Output:** Monitor and analyze heartbeat data through the ESP32's Serial Monitor for debugging and analysis purposes.
